      <h1>“Hope” is the thing with feathers</h1>
      <p>
        “Hope” is the thing with feathers -<br>
        That perches in the soul -<br>
        And sings the tune without the words -<br>
        And never stops - at all -<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard -<br>
        And sore must be the storm -<br>
        That could abash the little Bird<br>
        That kept so many warm -<br>
      </p>
      <p>
        I’ve heard it in the chillest land -<br>
        And on the strangest Sea -<br>
        Yet - never - in Extremity,<br>
        It asked a crumb - of me.<br>
      </p>

      <h1>Leaves</h1>
      <p>
        Years do odd things to identity.<br>
        What does it mean to say<br>
        I am that child in the photograph<br>
        at Kishamish in 1935?<br>
        Might as well say I am the shadow<br>
        of a leaf of the acacia tree<br>
        felled seventy years ago<br>
        moving on the page the child reads.<br>
        Might as well say I am the words she read<br>
        or the words I wrote in other years,<br>
        flicker of shade and sunlight<br>
        as the wind moves through the leaves.<br>

      <h1>Watering the Stones</h1>
      <p>
        Every summer I gather a few stones from<br>
        the beach and keep them in a glass bowl.<br>
        Now and again I cover them with water,<br>
        and they drink. There’s no question about<br>
        this; I put tinfoil over the bowl, tightly,<br>
        yet the water disappears. This doesn’t<br>
        mean we ever have a conversation, or that<br>
        they have the kind of feelings we do, yet<br>
        it might mean something. Whatever the<br>
        stones are, they don’t lie in the water<br>
        and do nothing.<br>
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>
        Some of my friends refuse to believe it<br>
        happens, even though they’ve seen it. But<br>
        a few others—I’ve seen them walking down<br>
        the beach holding a few stones, and they<br>
        look at them rather more closely now.<br>
        Once in a while, I swear, I’ve even heard<br>
        one or two of them saying “Hello.”<br>
        Which, I think, does no harm to anyone or<br>
        anything, does it?<br>
